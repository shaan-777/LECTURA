## üß† Our Approach

1.‚Å† ‚Å†*Why We Chose This Problem:*  
   As students, we struggled with NPTEL and YouTube-based learning resources‚Äîespecially during revision periods. Manually taking notes, revisiting long lectures, and preparing for exams was tedious and inefficient. We realized this wasn‚Äôt just our issue, but a common challenge for students and professionals alike, which led us to build Lectura.

2.‚Å† ‚Å†*Key Challenges We Addressed:*  
   We focused on eliminating manual note-taking, enabling offline access, and offering a personalized, test-driven learning experience. We also addressed the lack of real-time doubt resolution by integrating an AI chatbot that acts as a virtual tutor.

3.‚Å† ‚Å†*Pivots & Breakthroughs During Hacking:*  
   Initially, Lectura was only planned as a note generator. But during brainstorming, we realized the potential to extend it into a complete learning suite‚Äîwith flashcards, quizzes, and performance feedback. Adding podcast summarization and OCR support (via vision models) was a major pivot that made the platform more versatile.
